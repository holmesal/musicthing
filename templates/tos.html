			<h1><span class="muted">Terms of Use</span></h1>
			<p class="lead muted">Hello adventurer! You have found the Radius Terms of Use. They may be boring, but it's really important that you read and agree to them before using Radius.</p>
			<p class="lead muted">Our terms are pretty simple. Don't be a jerk to our bands. Don't take things that aren't yours. Don't try to sue us if your coffee's too hot.</p>
			<legend class="lead muted">For humans:</legend>
			<p class="lead muted">(Or: Some non-legally-binding guidelines):</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Music is owned by bands.
					<ul>Everything you hear on Radius is owned by artists. Their ownership of this music is governed by the <a href="http://soundcloud.com/terms-of-use">SoundCloud Terms of Use</a> and is distributed to Radius under the license they grant to SoundCloud and in accordance with the terms of the <a href="http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/terms-of-use">SoundCloud API Terms of Use</a>. We don't lay any claim to ownership of any music on Radius.</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li>Copyright infringement is bad.
					<ul>Don't post copyrighted material. See the SoundCloud guidelines on copyrighted material for more details. If you infringe upon these guidelines, we'll have to suspend your account.</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li>A pre-purchase is a commitment to buy.
					<ul>If you intend to pre-purchase a ticket, make sure that you're able to attend on that date. Tickets are only refunded in the case of band cancellations or acts of god.</ul>
				</li>
				
				<li>When in doubt, ask.
					<ul>If you've got a question about any part of Radius, don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:hello@getradi.us">drop us a line</a>. We work late.</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
